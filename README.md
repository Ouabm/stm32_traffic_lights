# stm32_traffic_lights
This exemple is a DEVS-based example running on an STM32H743ZI2 development board. It models a simple traffic lights exemple.

## Features

- Implemented using the DEVS formalism with Cadmium
- Runs on STM32H743ZI2 using ARM toolchain

## Prerequisites

- STM32H743ZI2 development board connected via USB
- Cadmium simulato installed
- ARM toolchain: `gcc-arm-none-eabi`

## Installation

1. **Install the ARM GCC toolchain**:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```
## Running 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ouabm/stm32_lab_project.git
```
  then
```bash
cd stm32_traffic_lights/
```
  then
```bash
./Build_stm32
```
